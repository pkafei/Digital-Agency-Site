## Introduction

I'm not an expert but I've been in an out of the tech enterpreneurship scene for a good part of the decade. One of the most dismaying behaviours I've seen green founders engage in is spending most of their time trying to lure VC money. The only time you should even think about VC money is if you are trying to build a billion dollar company in under ten years. If that isn't you then please stay clear from the VC world. The only money that you should be obsessing about is the money that is coming from your customers.



## VC Money has Ruined Entrepreneurship

Once upon a time, business was purely about supply and demand. The business owner picks up on an unmet demand, and dutifully supplies it to their customers. Customers reward business owners with money and patronage. Since the aughts, magazines like Fast Company, and Fortune have glorified firms like Union Square Venture and Andreessen Horowitz. Applauding successful firms is one thing, but giving impressionable entrepreneurs the notion that they need to be backed by a great VC firm in order to build their dream- is misleading. There is now a whole cottage industry that specifically grows companies with the purpose to appeal to future investors. The problem with this approach is that it shifts the conversation from how to make the best consumer or enterprise product to instead how to create the best performing asset for investors. Consumers and investors are very distinct audiences, and investors are seeking for the best return for their money. When companies secure outside funding they often have to cough up equity. If they give up too much equity away they risk ceding control and decision making power away to their investors. 

I get why VC money is attractive. For many new business owners the VC model is very close and familiar to the employee/employer relationship. Business owners do a good job and they are rewarded with a big pay day by a richer and more powerful entity. It is very similar to employment- you prove your worth and your company provides you with money for your survival. Most business owners need to resist this temptation and go out and build a product that appeals to customers. Read the [$100 Dollar Startup](http://100startup.com/) or [The Four Hour Work Week](https://fourhourworkweek.com/), most first businesses don't need an initial injection of investment capital. Which brings me to my next point.


## You are Not a Unicorn or a Harvard Dropout

You are not Mark Zuckerberg and your new business is not the next Google. The only time it makes sense for you to seek VC money if you are building a billion-dollar tech company in less than 10 years. If you are dedicated in masticating a whole vertical than it is wise to seek outside funding. But admit it- that's probably not you. If you are creating [straps for hipster moms in Brooklyn](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/style/clogs-no-6-moms.html), you probably don't need VC money.


## The Alternative? Bootstrapping!

Instead of primping in front of a bunch of VC investors- you can find ways to organically grow your business by bootstrapping. Bootstrapping- also known as "sweat equity" in VC parlance is an excellent way to build your business.
