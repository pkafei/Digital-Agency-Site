## Introduction

I'm not an expert but I've been in an out of the tech entrepreneurship scene for a good part of the decade. One of the most dismaying behaviors I've seen green founders engage in is spending most of their time trying to lure VC money. The only time you should consider requesting VC money is if you are trying to monopolize a particular vertical (like Amazon and retail).  Any other type of business would be wise to focus on customer generated revenue.



## VC Money has Ruined Entrepreneurship

Once upon a time, business was purely about supply and demand. The business owner picks up on an unmet demand, and supplies it to their customers. Customers reward business owners with money and patronage. Since the early aughts, the image what is needed to start business has changed. Before a business owner needed a business plan and clients. Now, people feel like they need to appeal to VCs or investors in order to get started. There is a whole cottage industry,[accelerators and incubators](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294798), which teaches newbie business owners how to attract VC funding. The problem with this approach is that it shifts the conversation from how to make the best product for consumers to instead how to create the best performing asset for investors. When companies secure outside funding they often have to cough up equity. If they give up too much equity away they risk ceding control and decision making powers away to their investors. 

I get why VC money is attractive. For many new business owners the VC model is very close to the employee/employer relationship. If founders do a good job and they are rewarded with another round of  funding by a richer and more powerful entity (their investor). This is quite similar to employment- you prove your worth and your company provides you with money for your survival. Most new business owners need to resist this temptation and go out and build a product that appeals to customers. Read the [$100 Dollar Startup](http://100startup.com/) or [The Four Hour Work Week](https://fourhourworkweek.com/), most first businesses don't need VC capital. Which brings me to my next point.



## You are Not a Unicorn or a Harvard Dropout

You are not Mark Zuckerberg and your new business is not the next Facebook. The only time it makes sense for a company to seek VC money is if it is trying to build a monopoly. If you are dedicated in masticating a whole vertical then it is wise to seek outside funding. But admit it- that's probably not you. If you are creating [straps for hipster moms in Brooklyn](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/style/clogs-no-6-moms.html), you probably don't need VC money.



## The Alternative? Bootstrapping!

Instead of primping in front of a bunch of VC investors- you can find ways to organically grow your business by bootstrapping. Bootstrapping- also known as "sweat equity" in VC parlance is an excellent way to build your business. How do you get started bootstrapping?


1. Dedicate nights and weekends to working on your project. Use a timer tracker as a way to keep yourself honest about the time that you are _really_ spending on your project. I personally use [toggl](https://toggl.com/), but honestly a kitchen timer will suffice. 



2. Staying motivated can be hard! It is hard to build a business when from 9-5 you are surrounded by other wage earners. Join a group of budding entrepreneurs to help you stay focused! My personal favorite group is [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) 


3. Focus on marketing from day one. Marketing is a great way to get invaluable feedback. Start running analytics on the blog posts and figure out which posts resonate the most with your audience.

## Conclusion

The focus of VC money makes starting a business look akin to joining a country club. You don't need to blessed by Silicon Valley Valley VC firm  in order to start building your dream today.
