#### **The Struggle**

Finding your first customers is a problem that many tech startups have. Most geeky founders specialize in building kick-ass products, but struggle in marketing. This use to be me- in my first startup PLB Analytics, I spent the majority of my time perfecting my programming techniques. After about a year of business- I had some killer Python data analytics skills but exactly 0 paying clients.  

#### Find Your Customers' Favorite Hangout Spots

It is not good enough to just be able to know who your audience is. You also have to know where your future customers hang out and discuss problems. The problem part is key, because ideally your company should be building a product or service that directly solves these problems. Traditionally, founders, especially developers, create a piece of software and __then__ try to convince people to purchase it. We are very bad at guessing what other people's pain points. It would be easier for us to observe what our target markets' most pressing problems, and then build products that solves these problems. [Amy Hoy does an excellent job of explaining how to find and identify key problems worth solving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exMoRoaxKtQ).

**Getting Your First Costumer and Product Market Fit**

I've spent five years watching what works and what doesn't when it comes to getting your first customers. I'm no guru, but I've seen some definite patterns emerge. Searching for customers is an excellent way to prove product-market fit. Let's say you have a freelancer productivity app- instead of building the application, send an email describing the features of your application to your targeted audience. Your email should:

-  Describe the problem your application is solving, preferably it is the same problem that your audience has ? ✍️ 
- Request for feedback on how you can improve your application ? ? 
- PUT A PAYMENT LINK on the bottom of the page and ask your audience to kindly pre-order your product ? ?  

Asking your audience to pay is the absolute best validation you can get about your product. It is very easy and low cost for someone to rave about your product. It is harder and more telling to ask the same person to back their glowing review with cold hard cash. Talk is cheap. Pre-orders also gives founders the freedom to build their product without worrying if their product will actually sell. 

#### **Partner with other Businesses**

One of the fastest ways to find customers is to partner with a business that already has clients. This works well for service businesses and products. If you are a logo designer you could partner with a freelance JavaScript developer. The developer can now offer another service to their clients. If you have a products you can create your own affiliate program and encourage developers to point their clients to your products. If you make a sale it is a win-win situation, you make extra money and the developer gets a percentage of the sale!

**Spread the Word**

If you build it- they will not care. Killer marketing is what separates businesses from hobbies. Your business is offering a valuable service or product, and the world needs to know about it! The good news is that it is not hard to get people to learn about your business. A good old-fashion blog and newsletter is a great way to reach potential clients. Even though we are living in the age of social media, surprisingly 66% of e-commerce purchases are made because of a newsletter. Not sure how to start your own newsletter?
